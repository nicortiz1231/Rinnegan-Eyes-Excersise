# Rinnegan-Eyes-Excercise

This is my version #2 of the Eye Movement exercise from MIT xPro course.

I wanted to put a spin on it so I referenced a character from the anime Naruto.

This project was very fun, wasn't anything too hard but definitley taught me a lot.

In the future will probably add different styles of eyes.
